<p>For two years, Fortnite went relatively quiet. In 2015, Mac compatibility was revealed.

Testing continued in the background, shifting from alpha to beta, and every now and then Fortnite made a press appearance, but there’s wasn’t a lot happening in the limelight.</p>

<p>In mid-2017, Fortnite kicked into high gear. In June, Epic began offering Fortnite Founders Packs for Save the World paid early access.</p>

<p>While Fortnite would eventually release as a free-to-play game, players who purchased Founders Packs joined the extensive early access period as well as reaping other bonuses.</p>

<p>In July, Save the World early access became available online for PC, Mac, Xbox One, and PS4.</p>

<p>In September 2017, Epic formally revealed Fortnite Battle Royale. Inspired by PUBG, Battle Royale was initially revealed as a separate mode within paid early access Save The World, but Battle Royale was quickly redefined as a distinct product free to everyone. Battle Royale featured no paid gameplay enhancements and a cosmetic-based FTP revenue model. Fortnite BR was released in late September on PC, Mac, Xbox One, and PS4.</p>

<p>In October, IGN released its review of Fortnite: Save the World early access, giving it a score of 6.5.</p>
