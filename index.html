<h2 align=center>2011</h2>
<p>In September of 2011, Microsoft published Epic’s Gears of War 3, the culmination of the original Gears trilogy. Only a couple of months later in December, Epic’s Cliff Bleszinski formally announced Fortnite at the Spike Video Game Awards, alongside an accompanying teaser trailer.</p>
<p>At a press conference backstage, Bleszinski elaborated on the inception of Fortnite, telling reporters: “It was a project that was pitched internally several months ago that came together lightning fast and something that seems like a no brainer to build.” He also explained that Fortnite is different from the shooters Epic has long been associated with, saying: “It’s a game that’s more about survival than anything else.”</p>
<p><strong>Fun Fact</strong>: Epic Games(i.e. Developers of Fortnite) made the game engine, Unreal Engine which was the engine used to make both PUBG and Fortnite.</p>
