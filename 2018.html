<p>In January 2018, The Map Update 2.2.0  began to define the Fortnite BR we all recognize today (including Tilted Towers). Regular updates started pouring out of Epic.</p>

<p>In March, Fortnite shook up the industry with several huge announcements.</p>

<p>An iOS beta was revealed. More strikingly, cross-platform play and progression between consoles, PC, and mobile devices were implemented.</p>

<p>Also in March, musician Drake joined Fortnite streamer Ninja in on online session that garnered record numbers of viewers and escalated public discussion around Fortnite to new heights. It also marked a trend toward Fortnite’s continued dominance in Twitch streaming.</p>

<p>Also in March, IGN reviewed Fornite: Battle Royale, scoring the game a 9.6.</p>

<p>The summer brought even more. In May, at the height of Infinity War mania, Thanos appeared in Fortnite Battle Royale as a limited-time gameplay enhancement.</p>

<p>In June, Fortnite came to Switch with crossplay to Xbox, PC, Mac, and mobile.</p>

<p>By July, Fortnite was a cultural phenomenon, cited as a notable nuisance in some schools, and had reportedly generated over one billion dollars from in-game purchases.</p>

<p>By August 2018, Fortnite had come to Android, and in September, PlayStation 4 broke down crossplay barriers with Xbox and Switch.</p>

<p>While still in early access, Fortnite has already become one of video games’ greatest success stories and shows little sign of slowing. With regular updates continuing, there’s no telling just how far Epic can continue to take Fortnite.</p>
